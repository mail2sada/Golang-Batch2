# Go-Building Blocks
1. ## Data Types
    Data types specify the type of data that a valid Go variable or constant can hold. In Go language, the types are divided into four categories as follows: 
    1. Basic type: 
    2. Aggregate type: 
    3. Reference type: 
    4. Interface type  

    Let's explore  one by one...

    Data Types | Basic | Aggregate | Reference | Interface | 
    --- | --- | --- | --- |--- |
    1 | Numbers | Array | Pointers | interface | 
    2 | strings | structs | Silice |  | 
    3 | booleans |        | maps |  | 
    4 |         |         | functions |  | 
    5 |         |         | channels |  | 
    

    1. Basic Data types.

        Number types are of 3 types

        1. Integers (Whole numbers +ve and -ve)
            Below list of data types are supported in Integers

    Integer Types | Description |
    --- | --- | 
    int8 | 8-bit signed integer | 
    int16 | 16-bit signed integer | 
    int32 | 32-bit signed integer |
    int64 | 64-bit signed integer | 
    uint8 | 8-bit unsigned integer| 
    uint16 | 16-bit unsigned integer | 
    uint32 | 32-bit unsigned integer | 
    uint64 | 64-bit unsigned integer | 
    int | Both int and uint contain same size, either 32 or 64 bit. | 
    uint | Both int and uint contain same size, either 32 or 64 bit. | 
    rune | It is a synonym of int32 and also represent Unicode code points. | 
    byte | It is a synonym of uint8. | 
    uintptr | It is an unsigned integer type. Its width is not defined, but its can hold all the bits of a pointer value.| 

        2. Floating Point (Franctional numbers)
    Data Type| 	Description | 
     --- | --- | 
    float32|	32-bit IEEE 754 floating-point number|
    float64|	64-bit IEEE 754 floating-point number|
