# Go-Building Blocks
1. ## Data Types
    Data types specify the type of data that a valid Go variable or constant can hold. In Go language, the types are divided into four categories as follows: 
    1. Basic type: 
       Numbers, strings, and booleans come under this category.
    2. Aggregate type: 
       Array and structs come under this category.
    3. Reference type: 
       Pointers, slices, maps, functions, and channels come under this category.
    4. Interface type  

    Let's explore  one by one...

    Data Types | Basic | Aggregate | Reference | Interface | 
    --- | --- | --- | --- |--- |
    1 | Numbers | Array | Silice | interface | 
    1 | Numbers | Array | Silice | interface | 
    1 | Numbers | Array | Silice | interface | 
    1 | Numbers | Array | Silice | interface | 
    1 | Numbers | Array | Silice | interface | 
    1 | Numbers | Array | Silice | interface | 

    1. Basic types
        1. Numbers
           Go language supports integers, floating point numbers and complex numbers

           ### Intgers types:
           <i><b>

        int8	    8-bit signed integer

        int16	16-bit signed integer

        int32	32-bit signed integer

        int64	64-bit signed integer

        uint8	8-bit unsigned integer

        uint16	16-bit unsigned integer

        uint32	32-bit unsigned integer

        uint64	64-bit unsigned integer

        int	    Both int and uint contain same size, either 32 or 64 bit.

        uint	Both int and uint contain same size, either 32 or 64 bit.

        rune    It is a synonym of int32 and also represent Unicode code points.

        byte    It is a synonym of uint8.

        uintptr	It is an unsigned integer type. Its width is not defined, but its can hold all the bits of a pointer value.
